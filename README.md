A Genshin Impact tracker for ascension and talent materials. 

1. You can toggle the characters you own, which allows you to change the ascension and talent levels
2. Changing the talent and ascension levels calculates the amount of items you have ascended, and how much you need in total for all characters
3. You can view all of the items and all of the values owned, ascended and needed there
4. It does not pull owned numbers from your account, so you must put that in yourself
5. There is an about page to describe who coded the site, who did the art for the character icons, and where the item images are from

It stores all of the values of ascension levels and talent levels to local storage - including the amount of items you own so that you can return with ease without re-entering everything all over again.

Probably could use a lot of reworking to make it function faster.

Originally coded on my personal github @enmae, but I wanted to make it a free website people could use :D
